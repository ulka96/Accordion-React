      question: "What is Machine Learning?",
      answer:
        "Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions based on data. It focuses on creating systems that can improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.",

      question: "How does Photosynthesis work?",
      answer:
        "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose (sugar) and oxygen. This process takes place in the chloroplasts of plant cells and involves complex biochemical reactions.",

      question: "What is the Water Cycle?",
      answer:
        "The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, is the continuous process of water movement on, above, and below the Earth's surface. It involves the evaporation of water from bodies of water and land, its condensation into clouds, and eventual precipitation as rain or snow, which replenishes water sources.",

      question: "Why is Climate Change a Concern?",
      answer:
        "Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global or regional climate patterns, largely driven by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. It leads to rising global temperatures, sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity, making it a major environmental and societal concern.",
      show: false,

      question: "How do Vaccines Work?",
      answer:
        "Vaccines work by stimulating the immune system to recognize and fight off specific pathogens, such as viruses or bacteria, without causing the actual disease. They contain weakened or inactivated forms of the pathogen or pieces of it, known as antigens, which trigger an immune response and the production of antibodies for future protection.",
